# EcoPorcine-Advancing-Post-Weaning-Diarrhea-Control-Strategies-in-Pigs
Welcome to EcoPorcine, an innovative research study aimed at enhancing post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) control strategies in pigs raised in piggeries. PWD is a globally significant disease, leading to increased mortality, weight loss, and higher antibiotic usage, causing economic losses for pig farmers. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the primary cause of this disease.


# Why EcoPorcine?

1. **Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance:** With the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli, EcoPorcine seeks alternative control strategies to reduce reliance on antimicrobials in combating PWD. The study explores the efficacy of various interventions as sustainable alternatives.

2. **Focus on Dietary Interventions:** The project evaluates the impact of specific dietary interventions, such as inclusion of additional dietary fiber and reduction of crude protein levels, to determine their effectiveness in controlling PWD and promoting pig health.

3. **Zinc Oxide (ZnO) Replacement:** With impending EU legislation prohibiting the use of ZnO by 2022, EcoPorcine investigates alternative measures to compensate for the loss of this beneficial additive in pig feed.

4. **Vaccination Strategy:** The study examines the efficacy of vaccination as a preventive measure against PWD in comparison to dietary interventions. Various vaccination protocols are evaluated to determine their potential to reduce disease incidence.

**Treatment Groups:**
EcoPorcine considers the following treatment groups (based on the dataset's variable "Treatment"):


A. Normal feed + ZnO

B. Normal feed + nutraceuticals (e.g., fibers)

C. Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 2 and 3

D. Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 1, 2, and 3

E. Vaccination + high energy/protein in phases 1, 2, and 3 + nutraceuticals


• ADWG0021 (average daily weight gain (g/day) in the period between 0 and 21 days post-weaning)
• ADWG2150 (between day 21 and day 50 post-weaning)
• ADWG0050 (period between 0 and 50 days post-weaning)

**Conclusion**

Finally, we discovered that treatments A and B significantly differed from the other treatments, indicating that they had an impact on the piglets. Additionally, we found that post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) affects pigs in piggeries all over the world and it's significant.  The most significant contributing factor to the illness is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
